# Arduino---Home-Automation-System

# Introduction 

Home automation system makes the operations of various home
appliances more convenient and saves energy. With the energy saving
concept, home automation or building automation makes life very
simple nowadays. It involves automatic controlling of all electrical or
electronic devices in homes or even remotely through wireless
communication. Centralized control of lighting equipments, , security
systems, kitchen appliances and all other equipments used in home
systems is possible with this system.

This system is mainly implemented by sensors and controlling
devices as shown in the figure. The sensors detects light, motion,
temperature and other sensing elements, and then send that data to the
main controlling devices.

Controllers may be personal computers/laptops, touch pads, smart
phones, etc., attached to the controlling devices like programmablelogic controllers that receive the information from the sensors. The
programmable controller allows to connect various sensors and
actuators through various input and output modules whether they are
analog or digital.
